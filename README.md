# Laser_Imaging_Crater
We use lasers to scan over crater generated by low velocity impacts in granular media. Camera is positioned at an angle of 45 degree to the level surface.
We image the laser line one by one each time and scan over the whole crater region. Up to now, the parallex error has been corrected to a rough aapproximation. There are more can be done to corrected this by setting up a function which relates the position of the camera to the angle beetween incoming light and the level surface. 

We are currently working on create an algorithm to calculate the mean of several measureement. This requires us to align the images well enough so that the fitted curves over lay each other with respect to their relative position to the center of crater.
